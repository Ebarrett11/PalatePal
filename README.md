*This is a version of the project that is 6 weeks out of date. Missng some important functionality and bug fixes. Will be updated in a few weeks.

**Abstract**\
This is a mobile application that allows students at Michigan State University to view and leave reviews for the dishes at supported dining halls.

**Motivation**\
The food quality at MSU dining halls is often of inconsistent quality. By crowd-sourcing reviews, students can know before they ask for a dish, that the dish will be good. This allows for a reduction in food waste and happier students.

**Functionality**
- Log in / Register (Authenticated with Firebase)
- Select the dining hall and view meals for the current day/time
- View/create reviews on every meal 
- Ability to easily get directions to any dining hall and a map view of all dining halls
